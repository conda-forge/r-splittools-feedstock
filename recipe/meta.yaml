  summary: Fast, lightweight toolkit for data splitting. Data sets can be partitioned into disjoint groups (e.g. into training, validation, and test) or into (repeated) k-folds for subsequent cross-validation. Besides basic splits, the package supports stratified, grouped as well as blocked splitting. Furthermore, cross-validation
    folds for time series data can be created. See e.g. Hastie et al. (2001) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7> for the basic background on data partitioning and cross-validation.
